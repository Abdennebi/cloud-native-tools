# Kubernetes Tools

## Developer Tools
- [Draft](https://github.com/Azure/draft): Draft makes it easy to build applications that run on Kubernetes. Draft targets the "inner loop" of a developer's workflow: as they hack on code, but before code is committed to version control.
- [Kubectx](https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectx): Fast way to switch between clusters and namespaces in kubectl 
- [Kube-ps1](https://github.com/jonmosco/kube-ps1): Kubernetes prompt info for bash and zsh
- [Skaffold](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/skaffold): Easy and Repeatable Kubernetes Development

## Ingress Controller
- [Contour](https://github.com/heptio/contour): Contour is a Kubernetes ingress controller for Lyft's Envoy proxy.
- [Kubemci](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/k8s-multicluster-ingress): kubemci is a tool to configure Kubernetes ingress to load balance traffic across multiple Kubernetes clusters.

## Debugging
- [Telepresence](https://www.telepresence.io/): Local development against a remote Kubernetes
- [Stern](https://github.com/wercker/stern): Stern allows you to tail multiple pods on Kubernetes and multiple containers within the pod. Each result is color coded for quicker debugging.

## Security
- [Kubesec](https://kubesec.io/)
- [Kube-hunter](https://github.com/aquasecurity/kube-hunter): Hunt for security weaknesses in Kubernetes clusters
- [Kube-bench](https://github.com/aquasecurity/kube-bench): The Kubernetes Bench for Security is a Go application that checks whether Kubernetes is deployed according to security best practices
- [Cert-manager](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/): Automatically provision and manage TLS certificates in Kubernetes
